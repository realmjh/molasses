## -- About the Project --
Molasses is a highly experimental CAD-oriented aerodynamics simulation software. The intended purpose of this project is to allow
for visual aerodynamical simulations of Computer Aided Design (CAD) models.

## -- Requirements -- 
A high-performance system is recommended if you choose to run this software. It's important to note that this was designed completely
on Linux and therefore I cannot confirm it's performance on Windows machines. Please use any Linux distro for the best performance possible.

* For futher clarification, this was developed on Linux Mint ðŸ’¯

## -- Copyright / Usage --
Anybody is free to use Molasses. I however, for this project, am operating a zero-corporate policy. This means that no company, corporation, or recognized-entity shall
use my code for their benefit. They are free to use the program, but may not use the code in any way, shape, or form.
